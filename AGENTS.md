# AGENTS.md  
Guide for autonomous coding agents (e.g., OpenAI Codex) working in **streamnative-mcp-server**

---

## 1 | Project snapshot
* **What it is** – A fast, developer-friendly **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that lets LLM agents talk to **Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, and StreamNative Cloud** through a single, consistent interface.  
* **Key outputs** – A single Go binary named **`snmcp`** (and a Docker image) that can run as a *stdio* or *SSE* server.  
* **Primary language / tooling** – Go 1.22+, `make`, `golangci-lint`, `goreleaser`.

## 2 | Repo map (orient yourself quickly)

| Path | What lives here | Touch with care? |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| `cmd/streamnative-mcp-server/` | `main.go` entry‑point for the CLI/server | **yes** |
| `pkg/` | Core library packages (Kafka tools, Pulsar tools, cloud integration, feature gating) | yes |
| `sdk/` | Thin Go client helpers (generated) | can be re‑generated |
| `docs/tools/` | One Markdown file per MCP tool – these are surfaced to the LLM at runtime | **yes** |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI (lint, unit test, release) | only if changing CI |
| `Makefile` | Local build helpers (`make build`, `make fix-license`, …) | safe |

---

## 3 | Required dev workflow

> **Agents MUST follow every step below before committing code or opening a PR.**

1. **Install deps**  
   ```bash
   brew install golangci-lint            # or use the install script
   go install github.com/elastic/go-licenser@latest
   ```

2. **Build & unit tests**  
   ```bash
   make build            # invokes `go build …` with version metadata
   go test ./...         # _there are few tests today – add more!_
   ```

3. **Static analysis & formatting**  
   Run `golangci-lint run` and ensure **zero** issues. Linters enabled include `govet`, `staticcheck`, `revive`, `gosec`, etc.  
   Follow `go fmt` / `goimports` import grouping.

4. **License headers**  
   ```bash
   make fix-license      # injects Apache 2.0 headers via go-licenser
   ```

5. **Generate artifacts** (only if you edited code‑gen files)  
   ```bash
   go generate ./...
   go mod tidy
   ```

6. **Commit & conventional message**  
   Use **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` …). Keep title ≤ 72 chars and add a body explaining _why_.

7. **Run the full release checks locally (optional but recommended)**  
   ```bash
   goreleaser release --snapshot --clean  # mirrors CI pipeline
   ```

---

## 4 | How to run the server locally

```bash
# StreamNative Cloud (stdio)
bin/snmcp stdio --organization $ORG --key-file my_sa.json
# External Kafka
bin/snmcp stdio --use-external-kafka --kafka-bootstrap-servers localhost:9092
# External Pulsar
bin/snmcp stdio --use-external-pulsar --pulsar-web-service-url http://localhost:8080
```

For HTTP/SSE mode add `sse --http-addr :9090 --http-path /mcp`.

---

## 5 | Coding conventions

* **Package layout** – one feature per package; avoid cyclic imports.  
* **Error handling** – wrap with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`; export sentinel errors where appropriate.  
* **Logging** – rely on `zap` (already imported) with structured fields.  
* **Tests** – use Go’s `testing` plus `testify/require`. When adding a tool, write at least:
  * happy‑path invocation
  * typical error path
  * integration stub (may be skipped with `-short`)

---

## 6 | Common tasks for agents

| Task | Checklist |
|------|-----------|
| **Add a new MCP tool** | 1) create package in `pkg/tools/...` 2) update `docs/tools/<tool>.md` 3) add to feature flag map 4) go‑vet + tests |
| **Bug fix** | reproduce with unit test first → fix → ensure lint/test pass |
| **Docs** | update both README **and** the per‑tool doc; regenerate table of contents |
| **Release prep** | bump version tag, update changelog, run `goreleaser release --snapshot` |

---

## 7 | Programmatic checks the agent MUST run

```bash
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run
go test ./...
make build                    # binary must compile for darwin/amd64 & linux/amd64
```

Codex **must not** finish a task until all checks pass locally. If CI fails, iterate until green.

---

## 8 | Pull‑request etiquette

* Open PR against `main`, no new branches needed.  
* Include a **Summary**, **Testing plan**, and **Docs updated** checklist.  
* Mention which `--features` flags were affected, so reviewers know what to smoke‑test.  
* If the change affects the public CLI, update `README.md` usage examples.

---

## 9 | AGENTS.md spec compliance

This file follows the AGENTS.md spec described in the Codex system message (scope, precedence, required programmatic checks, etc.).  

* Its scope is the **entire repository**.  
* Deeper‑level AGENTS.md (not currently present) may override these instructions for their subtree.  
* Direct human instructions in a prompt override anything here.

Happy hacking! 🚀
